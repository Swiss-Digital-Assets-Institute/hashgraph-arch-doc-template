= System Context

[NOTE]
This diagram shows the systems that are communicating and interacting within the scope of the Enterprise Guardian Platform. It shows the different systems and how they interact with each other. The diagram should be updated when new systems are added or removed from the platform.

The example below gives a view on the different types of components

== SysAdmin User
[NOTE] The SysAdmin User acts as the operational backbone of the Enterprise Guardian System, ensuring uninterrupted functionality and governance. Their responsibilities include:

- Managing tenants, including onboarding, access control, and lifecycle operations.
- Supervising backend workflows to ensure all processes function according to designed policies and security protocols.
- Inviting or creating registry accounts and establishing role-based permissions across the system.

The SysAdmin is integral to maintaining the integrity and scalability of the platform, ensuring a seamless experience for all stakeholders.

== Carbon Data Submitter (User)
[NOTE] The User, typically an entity or individual, represents the Carbon Data Submitter, tasked with:

- Uploading and submitting carbon-related data, including emissions, offsets, and reduction activities.
- Ensuring compliance with defined schemes and policies by the Registry Authority.
- Acting as the primary contributor of input data, enabling traceability and reporting within the platform.

This role is pivotal for driving data flow into the system, forming the basis for all downstream workflows and blockchain operations.


== Registry Authority

[NOTE] The Registry Authority is the policy maker and system designer for the platform. Their key functions include:

- Designing and implementing policies, schemes, and frameworks to guide data submissions.
- Creating and maintaining account structures to ensure compliance with regulatory and platform rules.
- Providing support and oversight for users to help navigate policy complexities.

As the custodians of compliance, Registry Authorities ensure the platform's functionality aligns with its governance mandates.

[NOTE]
The Registry Authority is responsible for creating, designing, and providing policies, schemes, accounts, and users. They are the primary designer of all policies within the workflow.
